# Augmented-Reality
This project focuses on detecting a custom AR Tag, that is used for obtaining a 
point of reference in the real world, such as in augmented reality applications. There are two aspects to using an AR Tag,
namely detection and tracking, both of which have been
plemented in this project. The detection stage will involve in finding the AR Tag from a given image sequence
while the tracking stage will involve keeping the tag in view throughout the sequence.
